Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period and is generally more affordable, making it a good choice if you want coverage for certain financial obligations, like a mortgage. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, offers lifelong coverage and includes a savings component, which can grow over time. It’s important to think about what fits your family's needs and future plans. I’m here to help you understand these options better and how they might support your financial goals."
